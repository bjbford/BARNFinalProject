# Story
Briefing: VORTEX, the code name for your development platform, includes the iRobot Create, the Cerebot
II board, and attachments such as the servo, SONAR, IR sensor, and LCD.

Your team has been asked to develop an interplanetary rover using the VORTEX platform. Both NASA
and the European Space Agency have heard about your work with this platform and have assigned your
team the job of designing the rover. Delegating this task will allow these agencies to focus on developing
a launch vehicle. The primary task of the rover is retrieval; other international teams are busy working
on a package that will collect rock samples and perform analysis. The VORTEX platform will be landing in
Martian terrain that is unknown to you. The only knowledge of the terrain you will have is that which
the VORTEX transmits to you.

At this early phase of the project, the only objective for you to complete is for the VORTEX platform to
traverse the hazardous terrain for retrieval at a predetermined rendezvous site.

The terrain is hazardous, so the VORTEX must be capable of navigating the hazards of the terrain. The
retrieval zone will be marked, so you will be able to recognize it from the information the VORTEX sends
you. After the VORTEX enters the retrieval zone, it should send signals to mission control indicating the
rover is ready for retrieval.
